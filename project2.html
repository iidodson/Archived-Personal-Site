<div class="content-text">
  <h3 class="text--headline">Background</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text">The User Testing Bug form is used as an internal tool for developers to
      report bugs to Quality Assurance (QA) engineers. The form's wordage and overall design was inconsistent
      which confused many users, ultimately resulting in QA engineers receiving incomplete or misinformation
      from the form. I redesigned the form to decrease user pain and user error when submitting and reduce inconsistencies
      in the data the QA team received.</p>
</div>


  <h3 class="text--headline">Methodology</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text">I began by using the form myself to understand its core functionality and the user experience. There
      were initial red flags for me that I could predict many users felt as well. After getting a feel for the form, I spoke with the
      QA team about its current state. </p>
      <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text"> My questions were geared towards understanding:</p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. The reasoning behind the design and engineering decisions of the form</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. How the form integrated into their workflow </p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">3. Which pieces of information were essential to their workflow vs which were not </p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">4. The language they used to categorize bugs</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">5. The pain points they had when processing bugs</p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text">I learned that due to the lack of conciseness in the form's directions, the team had to cypher through the majority
      of the data themselves, which slowed their workflow. It was important for me to design a form that reduced the chances of user error so the QA
       team's workflow would no longer be negatively affected. </p>
       <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text"> Next I started to speak with developers about their experiences using the form. I aimed to understand their pain
      points and suggestions on how to improve it. The common themes in these conversations were that:</p>
      <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. It took a lot of time to fill out the form  because of the amount of textual information
      that was required to submit.</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. The instructions for some of the input field were not clear which made the user confused
      or unsure about what information the form was truly asking for.</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">3. The overall design of the form did not match the brand identity of the company </p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text"> It was interesting to see that problems on the QA side and the users side matched up seamlessly. This explained
      why there was so much inconsistency on both ends. Because every field was an input field, there was a free range of data that the users could
      enter. It was clear that I needed to find another approach to the input field and make the instructions for each input clear and concise. </p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text">Through conducting these user interviews, the objectives of the form became clear.</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="text--headline">Objectives</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. Reduce time it takes customers to fill in form</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. Clarify instructions for each input</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">3. Get concise data that is more useful to QA</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="text--headline">Ideation</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text ">From the conversations I had with the QA team and the target users, I created to two user personas that shined
      very clearly in the interviews. </p>
      <div class="break"></div>
    <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
      <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting_blugfprm/bug_form_image2.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text ">Focusing on accomplishing these user goals, I worked on alternatives to the input field that were able to give
      the same level of preciseness (If not better) in the data. I listed out each input variation that I could think of, relevant to the form.
      I analyzed each input's advantages and disadvantages and created a grid to determine the effectiveness of using a specific input type for a
      given piece of information. This exercise aimed to reduce the inconsistencies in the data by giving each input more structure.  </p>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
        <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting_blugfprm/bug_form_image3.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
        <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting_blugfprm/bug_form_image4.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">Design</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text "> I took to pen and paper and began making various sketches of these ideas. I referred back to the list of
        above to ensure that each input type was relevant to that specific piece of data. I started off very board and worked to condense my
        ideas into the strongest sketches. </p>
        <div class="break"></div>
        <p class="text--body--text "> While there were multiple types of inputs I could use for each piece of data, I chose to incorporate
        visuals such as common icons to limit the user's textual input. In addition, I used "fill in the blank" sentence structures that were
        natural to the user when describing a bug. This also restricted the amount of typing the user had to do, which ultimately limited the amount
        of error the QA team would receive. After iterating on these concepts, I met with the QA team to make sure that the direction I was going in aligned with
           their goals</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text ">This was the final product:</p>
         <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting_blugfprm/bug_form_image5.png" alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">Results</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text ">While initially well received by the QA team and target users, this form was not implemented. Another direction was
        sought after to solve this problem. At this point my internship had come to an end and I was not able to validate the form's success at accomplishing
        the original goals.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">Conclusion</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text ">I recieved a deeper understanding
        of the QA workflow, bug processing, and pushed myself to think of creative solutions that expanded on the traditional form and saves the user
        time by limiting the amount textual input . I'm certain that in the future I'll be able to use these input field alternatives for another
        project.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">Acknowledgements</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text ">A special thanks to Emily, James, and Jurvis for their support while designing the form. I'm glad to have been a part of
        this.</p>
