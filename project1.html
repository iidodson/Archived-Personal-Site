<div class="content-text">
  <h3 class="text--headline">Overview</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text">As their platform grew, User Testing's frontend development team found it difficulty to keep UI
      styles and components consistent across their product. They hired me to build the Asset Toolkit, a centralized code based
      style guide for frontend developers to use as a resource when developing the product. The result was a mobile-first website
      that gave not only developers, but designers and product managers direct access to this information.</p>
  </p>
</div>


  <h3 class="text--headline">Objectives</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text ">My objectives for this project were to:</p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. Conduct market research on style guides</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. Administer usability tests to gauge visual and contextual successes and pain points for users</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">3. Design and iterate on a prototype that represents the goals of the frontend team and resolves major
       pain points for the user.</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">4. Code the prototype</p>
  </div>

  <h3 class="text--headline">Process</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text ">I began by speaking with members of the frontend team to gain a complete understanding of the team culture,
      existing brand, and their expectations for the toolkit. I learned that the team was implementing a new design system and wanted the newer
      styles to be showcased in the Asset Toolkit. It was important for me to build the Asset Toolkit in a way that visually represented the design
      system and was scalable for later additions to the design system.</p>
      <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text ">Next I started to interview designers and product managers at the company to understand how they could use this product
      as well. There was an interest in extending the scope of the project by incorporating more content into the toolkit such as mobile styles. This
      presented a challenge to me because it seemed that the overall scale of the project could exceed the duration of my internship. After regrouping
      with the frontend team and reassessing the objectives for the project, it became clear that my goal was to incorporate only desktop design components
      into the toolkit</p>
      <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text ">I continued to consider the desktop use cases for designers and product managers and initially started out with this list
       of use cases:</p>
       <div class="break"></div>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--sub-header">Frontend Developers need to:</p>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. View code for each design component</p>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. Know where to find the code internally</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--sub-header">Designers need to:</p>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. See visual representation of each style and component </p>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2.  Find specifications of each component</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--sub-header">Product managers:</p>
     <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. Read the use case for each component</p>
   </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">User Tests</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text ">After getting a better understanding of each team's needs, I began to research well known and documented style guides in the frontend
          community. Using the User Testing platform, I conducted user test on these style guides, using designers and developers in the industry as my focus group. The
          goal of these user tests was to understand:</p>
          <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. The type of content the user expected to find in a typical style guide</p>
      <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. The visual expectations users had for a style guide</p>
      <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2.  How the company's needs compared to the industry standards</p>
          <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image1.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="break"></div>
  </div>

  <h3 class="text--headline">Ideation</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text ">Once I gathered the results from the test, I described the common user patterns, expectations, and pain points back to the frontend team.
      This allowed us to expand on the initial needs of each user and condense the findings into these three user personas:</p>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image2.png" alt="" />
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image3.png" alt="" />
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image4.png" alt="" />
      </div>

    <p class="text--body--text ">It was clear that there were three main types of each information that needed to be present on each component page: a visual representation of
      each element, code to generate that element, and the element's use case. This put a greater emphasis on the organization of style guide because poor organization would
      jeopardize the overall usability of the product. Following the atomic design structure of User Testing's design system, I created an information architecture diagram for
      the project.</p>

      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image5.png" alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>

  <h3 class="text--headline">Wireframes</h3>
  <div class="text--body">
    <p class="text--body--text ">I finally began to put pencil to paper and start sketching. I made as many sketches as I could for both mobile and desktop devices, leaving no idea
      untouched even if it seemed out of reach.</p>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text ">I started out with a very broad range of designs..</p>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image6.jpg" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text ">With the help of the team, I narrowed down on the strongest designs that were able to best accomplish the goal of each user persona. I then used
        Sketch to view the wireframes on a device. This allowed me to understand the visual successes and constraints of the designs. </p>
        <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--sub-header">Take away points:</p>
    <div class="break"></div>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. While using a desktop device is the primary use case for this website, making it responsive resolves issues for edge case
      users</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. The copy to clipboard button should be removed on mobile devices because the majority of the frontend team has iOS devices,
      and Safari does not support this function.</p>
    <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">3. Adding the team's design principles to the homepage allowed the website to reflect the overall goals of frontend team and
      incorporate the objectives of the atomic design structure. </p>
  </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">Design</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text ">Once a clear direction was found from the wireframes, I began to bring them to life. I again started diverging on as many design options as I could.
        Here is a few of the many designs I experimented with for the branding color page.</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
        <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
            <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image7.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="break"></div>
        <p class="text--body--text ">Keeping the designs in line with the design system and brand identity was always my top priority and allowed me condense the designs based on their
        successfulness at accomplishing this. I Iterated on these designs through design sparrings and general feedback from the frontend team.</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text ">I ultimately chose to incorporated a molecular structure into the header image on the homepage to represents the structure of the asset toolkit and
        design system.</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
        <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
            <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image8.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text "> In addition, I designed custom icons to represent the three design principles of the frontend team: accessibility, consistency, and maturity.</p>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image9.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text ">Lastly, the final designs of the toolkit can be seen here:</p>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image10.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image11.png" alt="" />
      </div>
      <div class="break"></div>
      <div class="project-image project2-image--project1">
          <img class="project-image--html" src="img/usertesting/Asset_toolkit_image12.png" alt="" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">Result</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text ">I used Invision to simulate the user's experience when navigating through the website. After gaining approval from the team, designers, and product managers alike,
        I began to bring this project into reality. I used HTML, CSS, SASS, and Javascript to create a live website of the toolkit.
        This project was the blueprint for this overall product. Future iterations are still to come that will add more functionality and additional testing will be conducted to gauge how successful it was
        at accomplishing the goals of each user persona.</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text ">The User Testing Asset toolkit can be found <a class="embedded-links" href="http://toolkit.usertesting.com/">here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text--headline">Conclusion</h3>
    <div class="text--body">
      <p class="text--body--text ">The Asset Toolkit gave me many first. This was my first time designing with a team, conducting user tests and interviews, and following a formal design process. I am
        grateful for all of these first as they helped me realize my love for product design.</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text ">My main take away points from this design process were:</p>
        <div class="break"></div>
      <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">1. When conducting research on a product, get to know the people who built it, how that business operates, understand the user, and their expectations
        and constraints so that there is always a clear sense of the end user.</p>
      <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">2. When generating designs for a product, exasperate every design option possible. Even if it doesn't seem like it would be successful,  still sketch
          it out. There may be something that you can take away from it to incorporate into another design</p>
      <p class="text--body--text text--body--numbering">3. When presenting your work be, concise and straight to the point. Understand your audience and the type of information they are looking
        for and what aspects of the design process that they will find interesting. Presenting in a visual way also increases engagement.</p>
